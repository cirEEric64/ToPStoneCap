    <!--
    Create a silly personality quiz with a theme!
        Create a quiz, like what pokemon are you, or what is your irrational fear, then have a results page with info + pictures
    For both pages
    Required HTML components
        Complete html 5 base code (aka the boiler plate)
            Proper use of the head and body section - be able to explain what goes where
            Modify the title 
            Tags: <html>, <head>, <body>, <title>
        Add some text! You should have a title, and some relevant context or instructions
            Tags: <p>, <blockquote>, or <br> 
        Change the styling of the font 
            Tags: <h1> etc, <em> or <i>, <strong> or <b>, or use CSS
        Add a picture or gif!
            Tags: <img>
        Comment out a line

    In addition!! For the first page (the interactive page):
        Add a form with 4 questions 
            Select field with at least three options
            Radio input with at least three options
            Any other text-based input - of your choice -- use a placeholder
            A final input tag - something beyond what was covered in class 
            Make sure that the data from the 4 inputs below are accurately captured in the url after the submit button is pushed, 
            The form action should go to the second page

    In addition! For the second page (the informational page):
        Include an ordered and unordered list. Making it nested would be ideal!
        Include 2 anchor tags that link to another page
            One to a url
            And one back to the first page
